'''
My solution to Rosalind Bioinformatics Problem 025

Title: Genome Assembly as Shortest Superstring
Rosalind ID: LONG
Rosalind #: 025
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/long

Goal - Provided a list of sequencing reads and return a single string containing all
the given strings.

MANY ASSUMPTIONS!!!
1. No errors
2. No nested overlap, only on the ends
3. All reads will overlap
4. Reads will overlap by more than half their length
